        <h4>Grilled Cheese Sandwich</h4>
        
        <p>A grilled cheese is a hot sandwich typically prepared by heating one or
            more slices of cheese between slices of bread, with a cooking fat such as
            butter, on a frying pan, griddle, or sandwich toaster, until the bread browns
            and the cheese melts.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 slices white bread</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 slices Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a nonstick skillet over medium heat. Generously butter one side of a slice of bread. Place bread butter-side down in the hot skillet; add 1 slice of cheese. Butter a second slice of bread on one side and place butter-side up on top of cheese.</li>
            <li>Cook until lightly browned on one side; flip over and continue cooking until cheese is melted. Repeat with remaining 2 slices of bread, butter, and slice of cheese.</li>
        </ol>
